# Component-Library

A library of standard, highly customizable components

## Plans for Project

- Create various, stunning UI elements similar to that of my previous position, but better
- Combine everything I learned from my last position and demonstrate that I can do it again
- Expand what I know about frontend development and possibly coding in general - look into AI perhaps
- Write flawless tests to get practice and ensure I don't break my components in the future
- Tell a story somehow, maybe in the form of a game
